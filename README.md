I created an image-slider with JavaScript / CSS / HTML.

I created two Buttons n on the opposite site of the Screen. 
If you click on one of them a function is called which then gives the next sibling a data-attribute called [data-active] which has a higher opacity than 
the slides that havent the data-attribute [data-active].
